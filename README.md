# Meal Maker

personal project 4 - Meal Maker - The Helpful Meal Planner
created by Caleb *Cables* Universe. Feb 2024.

This project was made with JavaScript, HTML and SCSS.

## INFO

I am making this project in order to help make Dinner planning easier.

The user is given a calender of the month. They can drag and drop recipes from the recipe list on the left hand side on different days to help plan their meals.

Each meal comes with a short list of ingredients and a modal window that opens displaying the recipes instructions.

The shopping list on the right side is populated by the total amount of each ingredient. 

Users can print the Shopping List as an external file to take shopping with them.


## Current State

So far the Layout is mostly in place, and the side windows are half functional.

## Future Plans

Calender:
Drag and Drop system with Snap feature for dates.
Dates generated from the Date function in JS so date/weekday align.

Recipe Window:
Side buttons for filters.
Search bar.
Recipes.
Recipe Modal.

Shopping List:
List populated by calender meals.
Download Function.
